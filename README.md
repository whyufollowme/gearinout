This gearinout system is for Ubuntu or is built on ubuntu. it is a system that uses basic html and a sqlite to have a database for students to sign in and out camera gear
this system can be customized if you so please to use it with your school or gear.


(don't expect this repo to get updates quickly its only when i have to pull it to a device or reinstall it onto a device i use this repo)

once the system is installed with the curl command (something like this would work: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyufollowme/gearinout/main/install_gearinout.sh | bash)
use the command gearinout and it will boot the web portion of the system for you. once your system is booted then go to a web browser on that device and use http://localhost:5000 to get to the site.

this system does have an admin dashboard in it!! with a password. the demo password is currently 1234 this can and most likely will be changed later on.(please chnage it 1234 is really not a good password to use around students). other then that enjoy!!
